# heulingo: an ASP-based Implementation of Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search for Optimization

The heulingo solver is an ASP-based implementation of Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search (LNPS).
LNPS is an integration of systematic prioritized-search and SLS-based large neighborhood search
for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
LNPS starts with an initial solution and then iteratively tries to find improved solutions
by alternately destroying and prioritized-searching a current incumbent solution.
LNPS can not only find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of computation time
but also guarantee the optimality of obtained solutions.
