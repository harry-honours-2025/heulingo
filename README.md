# Heulingo

The _heulingo_ solver is an ASP-based implementation of _large neighborhood prioritized search_ (LNPS).
LNPS is an integration of systematic prioritized-search and SLS-based large neighborhood search for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

LNPS starts with an initial solution and then iteratively tries to find improved solutions by alternately destroying and prioritized-searching a current incumbent solution.
LNPS can not only find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of computation time but also guarantee the optimality of obtained solutions.
